Variables, Variables, and Variables
Let's get started
Today, we are starting our journey into development. This journey has to start somewhere. For this assignment, you will be making a program that demonstrates some programming fundamentals.

Objectives
Ensure your development environment is setup
Practice creating variables
Practice working with user input
Requirements
This should have been done in class, but make sure your laptop is set up and ready to go.

All your code should place inside the static void Main(string args[])

Explorer Mode
Create a new sdg-console app that does the following.

Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) that stores the numberOfCupsOfCoffee that you drink every day
Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) called fullName and set it equal to your full name.
Create a variable (use your best judgment for type) call today and set it equal to today's date.
using your variables, numberOfCupsOfCoffee, fullNameand today, Console.WriteLine out all three on one line.
Ask the user for their name and store it in a variable called 'user'.
Print out a greeting to the user, using their name
Ask the user to input two numbers
Get the numbers as Strings using Console.ReadLine
Convert a String to a double using double.parse. Save the first double value in an operand1 variable and the second double value in an operand2 variable
Add the operands and save in a sum variable
Subtract the operands and save in a difference variable
Divide the operands and save in a quotient variable
Multiply the operands and save in a product variable
Find the remainder when one operand is divided by the other and save in a remainder variable. See this page if you need to learn more about the modulo operator.
print all the results to the screen in a meaningful way.
